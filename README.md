# Data_structures
This repository can be helpful for anyone trying to seek a basic introduction about data structures. 
(All the codes in this repository are written in c++)

Each file contains code for a single topic / problem. Every file starts with comment section explaining what the code in that file does. This includes introduction, problem statement description, approach / algorithm used, functions - their input arguments and return value. A differentiating aspect of this repository is that it contains expected output at the end of each file along with logical representation of data stored in data structure before and after execution of the program. It becomes helpful when a person tries to interpret the working of an algoritm by glancing over it and executing the code isn't feasible.

The following data structures have been explained:
* [Linked Lists](#linked-lists)
* [Stack](#stack)
* [Queues](#queues)
* [Binary Trees](#binary-trees)

<!-- Linked Lists -->
## Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The linked list folder contains programs starting from basic operations like insertion / deletion of elements to some standard problems like checking presence of loop, reversing the list, merging two seperate lists, etc. This section even introduces doubly linked lists.


<!-- Stack -->
## Stack
Stack is a linear data struture that follows *Last In First Out (LIFO)* . This section contains multiple implementation techniques, basic operations and some applications of stack data structure like solving prefix and postfix expressions, balance parenthesis.

<!-- Queues -->
## Queues
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is *First In First Out (FIFO)* . A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

<!-- Binary Trees -->
## Binary Trees
A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”). This data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively. It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes, which are connected via edges. We can also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves connected with one another. This section includes different implementations, various traversals, basic operations, standard problems and construction of tree from given inorder, preorder and postorder traversal values.
