/* Sometimes two linked lists with different head pointers may merge into single list. In this program we aim to find 
   the merge point (also known as Y-intersection point).
   Let l1 and l2 be the length of the two linked lists as measured from their heads respectively. Let the two lists
   have n nodes in common. The differnce between l1 and l2 be d.
   Move d nodes in longer list and then by moving 1 node at time in both the list, they will meet at the coomon merge
   point.
